# Repecards

Repecards is a smart and engaging language-learning app designed to help users memorize new words efficiently through the power of spaced repetition and adaptive learning.

The app uses the principles of Ebbinghaus’s Forgetting Curve, ensuring that words are reviewed just before the user is likely to forget them. This method strengthens memory retention over time and makes the learning process more natural and effective.

## How It Works

When a user starts learning, they receive a card pack containing a set of new words grouped by theme — for example, “Animals and Fruits” or “Objects.” Each card in the pack represents a word, along with its meaning and visual representation.

The user interacts with the cards through short, dynamic challenges. As they progress, the app automatically adjusts the difficulty of these challenges:

Early stages: The user sees an image and must choose the correct translation from multiple options.

Later stages: As mastery increases, the user is asked to type the correct translation instead of selecting it, creating a more advanced recall exercise.

## Progress and Learning

Each word’s review schedule adapts based on how well the user remembers it. Words that are frequently answered correctly appear less often, while those that are forgotten reappear sooner for reinforcement.

Once the user learns most of the words from a pack, a new card pack becomes available, helping them expand their vocabulary step by step. Users can also manually unlock additional packs at any time if they wish to accelerate their learning journey.

## The Goal

Repecards aims to make language learning simple, intuitive, and scientifically effective. By combining visual memory, repetition, and increasing challenge levels, it creates a personalized path that helps users retain words for the long term — not just memorize them temporarily.
